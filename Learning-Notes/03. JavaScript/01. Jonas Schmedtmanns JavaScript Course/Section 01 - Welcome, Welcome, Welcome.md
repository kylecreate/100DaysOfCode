### Course Structure and Projects

JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world, but it also powers the modern web.
The course contains 20 sections and 60+ hours of video content.
- Learning the very basics of the JavaScript language in sections 2 and 3.
- Going to be learning some general skills as a developer (*problem solving, fixing errors, and more*)
- Building a project with the user interface
- In section 8, we'll be going over a more detailed look at how JavaScript really works
- In sections 9 and 10, we'll keep working on fundamentals of JavaScript with a focus on ES6 (ES2015) topics.
- In sections 11 and 12, going to build another project to learn array methods, numbers, dates, and timers
- In section 13, going to build another project of a web application/website.
- In section 14, going to learn the more advanced topic of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- In section 15, going to build a real-world map project, will also teach how to add a map and structure/plan a project
- In section 16, going to learn everything about Asynchronous JS, used for loading data from servers using AJAX
- In section 17 and 18, going to build another real world project to learn how to use 3rd party plugins/programs.
- In section 19, then we deploy our major project to Netlify/GitHub

Next step is to watch the next lecture and then how to navigate the course or start with the fundamentals pt.1 section

### Watch before you start!

Considerations before starting the course
1. **This course is for everyone!** Don't write a bad review right away if the course is too easy or too hard, or if you're progressing too slow. To make it perfect for you, you can re-watch lessons, jump to other sections/videos, or watch the video in slow/fast speed.
2. **You need to code along with him!** You will learn **ZERO** JavaScript skills by just sitting and watching him code. You have to code **YOURSELF!**
3. **Try all the coding challenges!** Try to do your best, but if you get stuck for too long, watch the solution. **Don't beat yourself up if you can't figure it out!** Just re-watch the lectures that were covered in the challenge, try to understand them better, and then move on. Watch for the "Pause the Video for Challenge" sign!
4. **If you want the course material to stick, take notes**. Notes on code syntax, notes on theory concepts, notes on everything!
5. **If this is your first time programming ever, don't get overwhelmed**. It's 100% normal that you won't understand everything at the beginning. Just don't think "*I guess coding is not for me!*". Everyone has different learning speeds.
6. In the first sections of the course, **don't bother understanding WHY things work the way they do in JavaScript**. Also, **don't stress about efficient code, fast code, or clean code**. While learning in the first few sections, we just want to make things **WORK**. We will understand the **WHY** later in the course.
7. **Before moving on from a section, make sure that you *understand exactly what was covered***. Take a break, review the code we wrote, review your notes, review the projects we built, and maybe even write some code yourself.
8. **If you have an error or a question, start by trying to solve it yourself!** This is essential for your progress. If you can't solve the problem, check the Q&A section. If that doesn't help, just ask a new question. Use a short description and post the code on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/).
9. **He recorded this on a Mac, but everything works the same way on Windows or Linux**. If something doesn't work on your computer, it's not because you're using a different OS.
10. **Most importantly, have fun! It's rewarding to see something that YOU built yourself!** So, if you're feeling frustrated, stop what you're doing and come back later.

### Setting up our Code Editor

Before writing any code, we need to install a code editor which is the main tool for any developer to write actual code.
*Going to be using VS Code*
*Talks about what color theme he's using and what extensions we'll be using*
