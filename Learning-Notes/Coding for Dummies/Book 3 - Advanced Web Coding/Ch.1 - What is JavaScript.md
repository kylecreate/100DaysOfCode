_“People understand me so poorly that they don’t even understand my complaint about them not understanding me.” —_ Søren Kierkegaard

- Some people over the years have called JavaScript either the worst or best programming language in the world.
- With recent improvements over the years, it's gotten better and much more popular than it was in the past.

## What is JavaScript?
- Back in the early days of the internet, browsers were simple readers for web pages with no capabilities except to display text and a few fonts.
- There was a war as Microsoft's Internet Explorer had features that others didn't. One displayed images, another introduced different fonts, and so on.

### The Eich-man cometh
- JavaScript first got it's start back in 1995 at [Netscape](https://isp.netscape.com/)
- Brandon Eich (_who created JavaScript back then_) wrote it in as few as 10 days from scratch and borrowing other features from other languages at that time.

### Mocha-licious
- The original name thought of for JavaScript was Mocha, which was renamed to LiveScript and then into JavaScript.
- The language was then built into Netscape 2 browser in 1995.
    - Microsoft reverse engineered the language and made a clone of it called [JScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript).
- Brandon then submitted the language to an organization called [Ecma International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International) and was then known and standardized as ECMAScript in 1997.

### We need more effects!
- When JavaScript debuted, it quickly became very popular as a way to make web pages more dynamic.
    - Falling snowflakes, popup windows, curling webpage corners, drop-down menus, and form validation.

## JavaScript Grows Up
- JavaScript has now become the world’s most widely used programming language and every personal computer in the world has at least one or more browser on it that can run JavaScript.
- Can be easily learned by non-programmers but powerful enough for professional programs to do some amazing things.
- Used on nearly ever massive website such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and others

### Common Misconceptions about JavaScript
- There have been plenty of rumors about JavaScript being good or bad. Some common misconceptions are…

**Myth #1**: JavaScript isn't a real programming language.
**Reality #1**: The language is often used for trivial tasks in a web browser which doesn't make it less of a language. There are now many features that are in JavaScript that are being intimidated by other languages such as C++, PHP, and Java.

**Myth #2**: JavaScript is related to Java
**Reality #2**: The name was invented for marketing strategy since Java was a popular programming language back in the 90's when JavaScript was first released.

**Myth #3**: JavaScript is new
**Reality #3**: JavaScript was created in the late 90's. Many programmers today weren't even born then!

**Myth #4**: JavaScript is buggy and runs differently in other browsers
**Reality #4**: This used to be the case a long time ago before all browsers were using a standard version of JavaScript. Now, every browser has the same version of JavaScript.

### Dynamic scripting language
- JavaScript is often described as a _dynamic scripting language_
    - Every computer programming language has a set of instructions and a certain way that humans must write those instructions.
    - For a computer to understand a programming language, it needs to go through a conversion process that translates human-readable (and writable) instructions into machine language.

### Compiled programming languages
- _Compiled programming languages_ are languages in which a programmer must write the code and then run it through a special program called a compiler that interprets the given code and then converts it into machine language.
    - Examples of these languages include: C++, Java, C, and COBOL

### Interpreted programming languages
- _Interpreted languages_ are technically still compiled by the computer into machine language, but the compiling takes place by the user’s web browser right as the program is being run.
    - There's no need to run a compiler like mentioned above.
    - Easy to make changes at any time needed.
    - Examples of these languages include: PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript.

### What does JavaScript do?
- You're using JavaScript all the time when browsing the web and don't even know it.
- There's such a large list of things that can be enabled with JavaScript
- You're also able to create web applications in JavaScript, such as Google Docs or Facebook.
- Some common uses for JavaScript on the web include…
    - Nifty effects
    - Input validation
    - Rollover effects
    - Drop-down/fly-out menus
    - Drag and drop features
    - Infinitely scrolling webpages
    - Autocomplete
    - Progress bars
    - Tabs within pages
    - Sortable lists

## Why JavaScript?
- JavaScript has become the standard for creating dynamic user interfaces for the web.
- JavaScript coding is the most popular and necessary skill for a modern web developer to have.

### JavaScript is easy to learn!
- Programming languages were originally created to give people a simple way to talk to their computers and tell them what to do. Compared with machine language, the language that the computer’s CPU speaks, every programming language is easy and understandable.
- An example of this is on page 168 where there's machine language and JavaScript of writing "Hello World" .

**TIP**: Once you learn the basic rules of the road (called the _syntax_), such as when to use parentheses and when to use curly brackets ({}), JavaScript resembles just plain old English.

**REMEMBER**: The first step in learning any language, including programming languages, is to get over your fear of getting started. You already have all the tools you need. Start small and work your way to make wonderful things!

### JavaScript is everywhere!
- Although JavaScript was originally designed to be used in web browsers, it has found a home in many other places.
    - Smartphones, web servers, tablets, and portable devices
- Most commonly in web browsers
- Client-side JavaScript adds interactivity to web page, such as…
    - Controlling the browser itself or making use of functionality of the browse.
    - Manipulating the structure and content of web pages.
    - Manipulating the styles (such as fonts and layout) of web pages.
    - Accessing data from other sources.
- To understand how JavaScript can manipulate and work with the structure and style of web pages, you need to know a little bit about HTML5 and CSS3.

### JavaScript is powerful!
- According to Google, JavaScript code runs up to 80 percent as fast as compiled code.
- JavaScript is much more powerful than the JavaScript of just a few years ago and many times more powerful than the JavaScript that was first introduced in 1995.

### JavaScript is in demand!
- It one of the most in-demand skill in the information technology (IT) job market.
- It’s projected that the job market for JavaScript programmers will increase by **13 percent** between 2020 and 2030.
