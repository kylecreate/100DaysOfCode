## Defining what code is
* Computer code is not a cryptic activity reserved for geniuses and oracles. Code runs traffic lights, computers, cell phones, and even space ships headed for outer space.

### Following Instructions
* Computer code is a set of statements, similar to sentences in English. Each statement directs the computer to perform a single step or instruction.
	* Asking for directions somewhere from a human can be vague.
		* “Head to the back of the restaurant to the middle door to get to the bathroom.”
	* Asking for directions from a computer using its code can be very descriptive.
		* “From this table, walk northeast 40 paces. Then turn right and walk 5 paces at a 90 degree angle. Next, turn left 90 degrees and walk 5 paces. Open the door in front of you and walk into the restroom.”
	* Another example of this is looking at the lines of code provided in figure 1-1 from the game Pong. There’s no need to worry about what’s being mentioned. However, you can find how complex a project/website/web application is based on the number of lines of code it has.
		* Pong Game - 5,000 lines
		* Facebook - 10 million+ lines
	===ALERT===: Be careful of only using lines of code as a measurement of a project/program’s complexity. 100 well written lines of code can do the same as 1,000 poorly written lines of code.

### Writing Code with some Angry Birds
* For someone who’s never written code before, you can learn from doing different “programs” at [hourofcode.com](https://hourofcode.com). These different programs are meant to give you the experience of how coding is using different building blocks of pre-written code. The most important take away from these tutorials is to understand that computer programs use code to literally and exactly tell the computer a set of instructions.

## Understanding what Coding Can Do for You
* Can can and is used to perform tasks and solve problems that you can experience everyday.
	* Apps, Websites, Web Apps, etc..
* With the rise of web applications, internet connectivity, and mobile phones have inserted software programs into daily life and lowered the barrier for you to become a creator, solving problems that are both personal and professional.

### Eating the world with software
* In 2011, [[ Marc Andreessen]], creator of one of the first browsers, Netscape Navigator, and now venture capitalist, noted that “*software is eating the world*”. He predicted that the rise of software companies would be disrupt existing companies at a rapid pace.
* Three trends have dramatically increased the use of code in everyday life.
	* **Web Based Software**: This software operators in the browser without having to install or download anything.
	* **Internet Broadband Connectivity**: Broadband connectivity has increased, providing a fast Internet connection to more people in the last few years than in the previous decade.
	* **Mobile Phones**: Today’s smartphones bring programs with you wherever you go and help supply data to programs.
* The combination of these trends has created software companies that have upended in almost every industry.
	* **AirBNB**: Peer-to-Peer lodging that owns no rooms/homes, but books more nights than Hilton in a year.
	* **Uber**: Car transportation company that owns no vehicles and book more trips than a regular taxi service.
	* **Groupon**: A daily deals company that generated almost $1billion after 2 years in business, growing faster than any company.

### Coding on the job
* Coding can be useful in the workplace.
* As of recently, it’s starting to gain relevance in different workplaces.
* Some examples where coding is playing a larger role on a job.
* *Book 7 covers more info about careers in coding~*
	* <u>Advertising</u>: Those who understand code in advertising can see successful key-words that are used by competitors and use that data to create a more effect campaign for their company.
	* <u>Marketing</u>: Those who understand code in this area of work can query customer databases and create a personalized communication which includes names that are tailored to specific interests/products.
	* <u>Sales</u>: Those who work in sales can retrieve their own leads of information from different websites known as *scraping*.
	* <u>Design</u>: If a designer creates a webpage mockup in Photoshop/Figma/Penpot, then they’re able to take their designs and code the webpage themselves instead of finding someone to do it for them.
	* <u>Public Relations</u>: Depending on how announcements or news comes from a company, someone can go through comments and analyze individual messages from hundreds or thousands of people.
	* <u>Operations</u>: By analyzing a company’s costs, those who work in this area can write a program to optimize packaging methods, loading routes, and delivery routes.

### Scratching your own itch (and becoming rich and famous)
* The path from idea to functioning prototype used by others involves a good amount of time and work, but might be more achievable than you think.
	* Example: [Coffitivity](https://coffitivity.com/), a productivity website that streams ambient coffee shop sounds to create white noise. The website was created by two people who had just learned how to program a few months prior. Shortly after [Coffitivity](https://coffitivity.com/) launched, TIME magazine named the website one of 50 Best Websites of 2013, and the Wall Street Journal also reviewed the website
* Having a goal for a website or app that you want to build is one of the best ways to learn how to code. When coming across a difficult bug or concept, the idea of bringing the website/app to life will provide that motivation to keep going.
* <u>DO NOT LEARN HOW TO CODE to become rich and famous</u>, as the probability of your website or app becoming successful is largely due to factors out of your control.
* Using the characteristics of the [hook model](https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-manufacture-desire/), a consumer passes through these phases, he builds habits in the process. After the cycle is complete, his habits have been reinforced and the product even has more value to him.
	* Trigger
	* Action
	* Variable Reward
	* Investment

## Surveying the Types of Programming Languages
* Code comes in different flavors that are called *programming languages*.
	* Possibly 9,000+ different languages, won’t mention them all
	* Popular ones include…
		* JavaScript
		* Python
		* Java
		* Rust
		* Ruby
		* Go
		* Kotlin
		* R
		* PHP
		* C
		* C++
		* Dart
		* Swift
* Programming languages are like the spoken languages of the world as they can share the same characteristics, such as:
	* <u>Functionality across languages</u>: They can create the same functionality similar to how spoken languages express the same objects, phrases, and emotions.
	* <u>Syntax and Structure</u>: Certain commands in programming languages can overlap just like words in other languages. When outputting text to screen in Python/Ruby, you use the `print` command. This is similar to `imprimer` and `imprimir` which are the verbs for “print” in French and Spanish.
	* <u>Natural Lifespan</u>: Programming languages are born when a programmer thinks of a new/easier way to express a concept. If others agree, then they’ll adopt the language for their own programs which then spreads the language. However, if the new programming language isn’t adopted by others, then the language slowly dies from use.
* They can also differ in a few ways:
	* <u>One creator</u>: Programming languages can be created by one person in a short amount of time like a few days.
		* JavaScript was created by Brandon Eich in 10 days back in 1995.
		* Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980’s as a hobby project.
		* Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the late 1990’s as a hobby project.
	* <u>Written in English</u>: Unlike the current spoken languages of the world, almost all of them are written in English no matter where the programmer is from. They all use the same English keywords.
		* Some languages were made to be non-English, but they aren’t as widespread or used.

### Comparing low-level and high-level programming languages
* One way to classify programming languages is either as low-level or high-level languages.
	* <u>Low-level languages</u> interact with the computer processor or CPU directly. They’re generally hard to read, usually in **machine code (0’s and 1’s)**.
	* <u>High-level languages</u> use natural language which makes it easier for people to read and write. Since these are easier to read than low-level languages, examples of this include **C++, Python, or Ruby**.

### Contrasting compiled code and interpreted code
* High-level languages must be converted to low-level languages by using an interpreter or compiler depending on the language.
* Languages like <u>JavaScript, Python, or Ruby</u> are interpreted which works with the program directly. The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement one line at a time into machine code.
	* *Mainly used for websites and or databases*
* Languages like <u>C++, COBOL, and Visual Basic</u>, after the code is written a compiler translates all the code into machine code, and an executable file is created *(.exe)*. This file can then be distributed from a website or app store and run.
	* *This includes programs like Microsoft Office, Photoshop, etc.*

### Programming for the web
* Software accessible on websites is gradually starting to take over installed software.
	* Programs like Windows Media Player have been **replaced** with websites like YouTube and Netflix.
	* Word processing programs like Microsoft Word and Excel have been **replaced** by Google Docs/Sheets

## Taking a Tour of a Web App Built with Code
* Using an example of [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/), this website allows you to search and find crowd sourced reviews for local businesses, restaurants, nightlife, and more in all cities in the US. Even though the purpose of the website is still the same, the design of the website has changed over the years.
	* The website looked different from 2004 to 2022 *(even in 2024)* as seen in Figure 1-5 on page 16.

### Defining the app’s purpose and scope
* Once understanding an app’s purpose, you can then identify a few tasks a user should be able to perform and achieve. For Yelp, the website has allowed users to…
	* Search local listings based on venue type and location
	* Browse listing results for address, hours, reviews, photos, and location on a map.
* Adding too many features to an app dilutes the strength of the existing features, and so is avoided by most developers.
	* An example of this is that it took Yelp, after 10 years, to allow users to make reservations at a certain restaurant from their website.

### Standing on the shoulders of Giants
* Developers tend to make strategic choices and decide which parts of the app to code themselves, and which parts of the app to use code built by others.
	* Often using third-party providers for functionality.
	* Another example of this is with Yelp using Google Maps to show the listings of local businesses, restaurants, and nightlife on a map. (*Refer to figure 1-6 on page 17*)
