Lists are very useful and used in many places on the web.
There are 3 different types of list…
1. Ordered lists
2. Unordered lists
3. Description lists

[Ordered List - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol)
* This element represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.
	* Example: A list of how to bake something from a recipe

[Unordered List - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)
* This element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.
	* Example: A list of needed ingredients for a recipe.

[Description List - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl)
* This element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the `<dt>` element) and descriptions (provided by `<dd>` elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).
	* Example: Like doing a vocabulary assignment in school, just formatted better instead of writing everything out.
