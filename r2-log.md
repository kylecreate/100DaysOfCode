  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * How to do a complete CSS reset for a new webpage and how to create a design system from scratch using the classes we've created so far.

  ### Thoughts:
  * The design system is actually kind of fun to work on before starting on the website itself. Also, with all the classes that have been used so far, I find this to be a really good idea for HUGE projects in the future.
