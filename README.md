# 100 Days of Code

**Main target:** ***I will code for at least an one hour every weekday for the next 100 days.***

This challenge for 100 days is to make a habit of coding to develop my skill sets to become a Frontend Developer. I was inspired by others completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge on Twitter and Discord. More details about this challenge can be found here: [100daysofcode.com](http://100daysofcode.com/ "100daysofcode.com") or [the official repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code "the official repo").

I started during late-2023, but found that my path wasn't very successful. So, I'm going to restart my progress and hopefully gain better knowldge.
