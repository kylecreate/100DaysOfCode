  ### Today's Progress:
  * I continued working on the Responsive Design module (96% complete) of the Frontend Mentor Frontend Dev path (52% complete) from Scrimba.
    * I continued working and completed on the Building a Product Splash Page section (100% complete).
    * I started and completed working on Building a Responsive Layout with CSS Grid (100% complete).
    * I briefly started working on the Learning Journal solo project.

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * I learned how the `box-sizing: border-box` tag works when using CSS (makes sense with it being inside of a CSS Reset), how grid columns, rows, and gap works, the fr unit and how it works, how grid-template-areas work, and how to create a responsive image grid.

  ### Thoughts:
  * I'm happy with how far I got today. Tomorrow, I'm going to get a start on the Learning Journal solo project as I just got the basics of it setup for myself. Here's the next 100 days!

  ### Today's Progress:
  * I continued working on the Responsive Design module (96% complete) of the Frontend Mentor Frontend Dev path (52% complete) from Scrimba.
    * I started really working on the Learning Journal solo project.

  ### Link to work:

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * None

  ### Thoughts:
  * I took the time to rename every layer/group in the Penpot file (ported the Project's Figma file) and moved different layers around that would make sense to me. From there, I wrote out my CSS Reset and custom properties that I believe the project would need. Afterwards, I wrote out my templates with random text to get an idea for what I was doing. I'm enjoying the project so far, I'm excited to see what I can do with it!

  ### Thoughts:
  * Penpot was finally working today after they fixed the bug or it just went away. I decided to use Figma for a little bit to see if that would work, and thankfully it did. I completed the Home page and part of the Blog/About page which I'll continue next week.
