  ### Today's Progress:
  * I continued working on the Responsive Design module (96% complete) of the Frontend Mentor Frontend Dev path (52% complete) from Scrimba.
    * I continued working and completed on the Building a Product Splash Page section (100% complete).
    * I started and completed working on Building a Responsive Layout with CSS Grid (100% complete).
    * I briefly started working on the Learning Journal solo project.

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * I learned how the `box-sizing: border-box` tag works when using CSS (makes sense with it being inside of a CSS Reset), how grid columns, rows, and gap works, the fr unit and how it works, how grid-template-areas work, and how to create a responsive image grid.

  ### Thoughts:
  * I'm happy with how far I got today. Tomorrow, I'm going to get a start on the Learning Journal solo project as I just got the basics of it setup for myself. Here's the next 100 days!

  ### Today's Progress:
  * I continued working on the Responsive Design module (96% complete) of the Frontend Mentor Frontend Dev path (52% complete) from Scrimba.
    * I started really working on the Learning Journal solo project.

  ### Link to work:

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * None

  ### Thoughts:
  * I took the time to rename every layer/group in the Penpot file (ported the Project's Figma file) and moved different layers around that would make sense to me. From there, I wrote out my CSS Reset and custom properties that I believe the project would need. Afterwards, I wrote out my templates with random text to get an idea for what I was doing. I'm enjoying the project so far, I'm excited to see what I can do with it!

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * How to create a calendar in HTML/CSS. Not sure how useful it will be in the future, but I understand it now.

  ### Thoughts:
  * I originally had a late start to my day, but I got these 2 done which is good. I'm now caught up on doing 1 project from each section of my list as I'll be able to go back and forth now.

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * How to create a tooltip and how to create a flag like the French flag.

  ### Thoughts:
  * I had a little trouble with the French flag since I wasn't sure how to turn it on its side. After watching the solution after getting fairly far and trying many different ideas, it made sense to make each stripe a flex-grow of 1.

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * I learned more about accessibility and layouts with the last project that I'm working on.

  ### Thoughts:
  * Another productive day! My goal was to finish all 3, but I didn't want to burn myself out with this last MDN project. I pretty much re-wrote the whole HTML and I'm in progress with the CSS. Everything is coming along nicely!

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * I learned more about positioning while working on the Switzerland flag from Scrimba.

  ### Thoughts:
  * In the future, I may go back and work more on the Accessibility Troubleshooting project from MDN since something doesn't feel right about it in my eyes. My HTML feels right, but the CSS needs a bit more work. Also, I may change the font since it's hard to read to begin with.

  ### Thoughts:
  * I probably could've gotten more done today if the power wasn't out for maintenance this morning. But, as long as I got a few things done, I'm happy. As I work on these Scrimba challenges before moving onto my next section of projects, I'm going to take some time to write out/plan some project ideas for myself. Gotta work hard to play hard in the future!

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * I learned how to create a toggle switch using CSS only and a HTML label and checkbox.

  ### Thoughts:
  * Out of the two that I worked on today, the Toggle Switch was the one I was unsure about. After looking at other examples of a toggle switch using HTML/CSS only, there's easier ways to make one of these for sure. As for my other project ideas, some are simple ideas and others are for the distant future using ReactJS but designing them in Penpot.

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * I learned about many different CSS techniques of making a card flip when hovering, how to make a spinning loading animation, and how to adjust a progress bar.

  ### Thoughts:
  * Today was a busy day! I have 2 more CSS challenges from Scrimba to complete before I've completed my Beginner project list and move onto my Intermediate list. For the past 2 weeks or so, I've been getting 4 emails every night from bots that send me blank messages on my contact form. Because of that, I've added a captcha to the form thanks to the Web3Forms docs instructions.

  ### New thing(s) learned:

  ### Thoughts:
  * My goal is to go through the projects site I created yesterday and make sure everything looks good before moving onto the JavaScript projects I have planned out. It's mostly images, spacing, and small mistakes on some of my projects that I need to fix. I didn't realize it until now, but it's better late than never I suppose. Also, I uploaded my Frontend Mentor projects to their site and fixed a few things from the feedback I received. A very busy day!

  * Started working on Frontend Mentor's FAQ Accordion project.

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * How to properly link a font (instead of importing through the CSS, I should link to it on the HTML page).

  ### Thoughts:
  * With so many images and fonts, I forgot to link them properly when hosting them on something like Netlify. I'm glad I went back and fixed all of that for all my projects. Hopefully I don't make that mistake again. As for starting the FEM project, I organized my files and started my global CSS reset and stylings before starting on the HTML.

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * I learned some basic JavaScript of loops and if/else statements.

  ### Thoughts:
  * Originally, I started out by working on the FAQ Accordion from Frontend Mentor, but didn't feel right for some reason. So, I switched over to freeCodeCamp to work on their JavaScript course and start on the Pyramid Generator project. This was a lot of fun and a lot of thinking.

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * What JavaScript is, how JavaScript works, how to do basic math, and how to round numbers using Math.round().

  ### Thoughts:
  * I decided to go back and learn JavaScript slowly because I feel like I still don't really understand it after all of the time I spent learning it originally. It definitely is like learning a second language. My goal after this is to have a better understanding of JavaScript and work on more projects for my portfolio! My goal is to take my time and learn, take notes, read more, and work on exercises whenever and wherever I can.

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  * I learned about the basics of Functions and Objects within JavaScript, how they work, and how to track code when trying to find a problem.

  ### Thoughts:
  * Today was a busy day since I won't be around tomorrow to work on anything. I learned a lot and figured this would give me time to take everything in and learn from it since it's a lot. Also, I need to work on my notes more and make some code snippets for both features of JavaScript. This is also the longest I've worked while working on my journey coming in at 3.8 hrs!

You just never know when you'll need something. Always good to help your future self! I feel bad I'm taking so long to learn some of this stuff since I've been at it for so long, but I just want to get a good understanding of everything before jumping into stuff. Does that make sense?

  * It's a weird day since personal things are going on, but I wanted to touch a few things to get running. After uploading my projects to roadmap.sh and going over some project ideas, I asked in the r/webdev discord about looking for some feedback on my learning journey and where I should be going.
